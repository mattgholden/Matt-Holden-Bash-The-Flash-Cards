Matt Holden's: Bash! The Flash Cards
====================================

Introduction
------------
Flash Cards! A great study tool used for many years.  Now there is a web application that you can put your basic software engineering knowledge to the test.  I introduce to you,
"Bash! The Flash Cards" not only because it rhymes, but because it is also related to software engineering ðŸ˜Ž.  Are you looking to get ready for a HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
test?  Well look no further!  This was built as my first project in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Course.

Technologies Used
-----------------
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript


Installation Instructions
-------------------------
* Clone the repository into a local file on your device
* Open the index.html file and play on

User Stories
------------
My users are those looking to quickly study some basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript questions.
As a user, they want to be able to view a card and click to flip the card over to begin quizzing.
As a user, they want to be able to click/push the "Correct" button when answer a flash card correctly or click/push the "Incorrect" button when they have the wrong answer to a flash card.
As a user, they want to know when they win or pass so they can stop the game.

MVP
---
* The page should ask the user to start with instructions then preload with all cards flipped on the front side
* The page should have 3 categories ("HTML", "CSS", and "JS") that each have 3 flash cards per category (rows of 3 & columns of 3)
* Click cards to flip to the back then front of the card
* Click on "Correct" or "Incorrect" button to add the total flash cards answered correctly
* The game alerts Win (9 "correct" to win, otherwise = continue).
